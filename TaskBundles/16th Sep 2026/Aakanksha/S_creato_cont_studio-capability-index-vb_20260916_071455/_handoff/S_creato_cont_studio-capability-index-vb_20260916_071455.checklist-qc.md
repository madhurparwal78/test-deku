Machine draft from checklist_qc.py. The adjudicator reads instruction.md and checklist.md, resolves the coverage proposal below, and replaces this file.

## Structural findings (decided in full by the script)

- none: structure, ids, tags, citations and reconciliation hold.

## Coverage-ledger arithmetic (decided in full)

- none: every ledger row has items >= obligation sentences and matches the body.

## Obligation segmentation proposal (the adjudicator decides)

Recomputed obligation-bearing sentence counts per instruction section. The adjudicator confirms which are real obligations and pairs each to an item (COVERED / REVIEW / UNCOVERED).

## Method and limits

This layer decides structure, ids, citations and ledger arithmetic in full. It only proposes obligation segmentation; coverage pairing and invention are the adjudicator's. A checklist can conform in full and still describe the wrong application.
